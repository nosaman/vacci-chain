Doctors:
* On each vaccine injection they must ‘register’ the patient by sending a sms from the patient phone with the code
* When a patient come to the clinic, they ask the patient to send a sms and they receive the vaccination history information on the patient’s phone
* If check a vial and see it is marked as ‘disposed’ - they know not to use it
* If they check a vial and get no results - they know it is a fake 

Manufacturers
* They need to write each vial code into the blockchain
* They need to print a code on each vial
* Each time a code is being checked or activated they can know where it is located in the world

Patients
* They can receive their vaccination information by sending a SMS
* They can choose permissions for being contacted by vaccine producers, and who they want to give access to
