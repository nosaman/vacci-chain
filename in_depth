Doctors:
* On each vaccine injection they must ‘register’ the patient by sending a sms from the patient phone with the code
* When a patient come to the clinic, they ask the patient to send a sms and they receive the vaccination history information on the patient’s phone
* If check a vial and see it is marked as ‘disposed’ - they know not to use it
* If they check a vial and get no results - they know it is a fake 

Manufacturers
* They need to write each vial code into the blockchain
* They need to print a code on each vial
* Each time a code is being checked or activated they can know where it is located in the world

Patients
* They can receive their vaccination information by sending a SMS
* They can choose permissions for being contacted by vaccine producers, and who they want to give access to 


Technical 

1. Each vaccine vial is registered on a blockchain.
2. Smart contract allow each vial to be marked first as ‘new’, ‘administered’ & ‘disposed’

* If a bach is being ‘disposed’ - the manufacturer can mark all the veils as ‘disposed’
* Expiration date will automatically mark the vial as ‘disposed’

* Blockchain log for edding new vials, showing:
    - Vaccine name and code
    - Manufacture date
    - Manufacture place (code)
    - Expiration date
    - Status 
    - Status date change
    - Phone number (only after administration) (searchable)


* Smart contract that marks vaccine in one of 3 states:
    - New
