# vacci-chain
blockchain vaccinations logging and tracking system

PROBLEM: 
People (for the most part) want to be appropriately immunized, but with legacy systems poor recording, lack of integration, miss out on important vaccinations for them and their family. 

In addition, governments and insurers want to promote great vaccination practice and immaculate verifiable record systems, but often utilize legacy non-scalable systems with poor cryptography, and systems often inaccessible to those who most need them - consumers. 

Manufacturers - keen to ensure their vaccines are safe, widely distributed and taken as appropriate - lack the ability to connect with consumers nor receive verified feedback. They lack the ability to create meaningful consumer relationships.

MISSION: 
To create secure, accessible, and intuitive consumer owned digital vaccination records, with seamless connectivity to manufacturers, and the health community
